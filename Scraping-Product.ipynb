They are impregnated with absorbable modified bovine gelatin for temporary sealing. The outer surfaces of the prostheses are coated by a metallic silver layer to inhibit microbial adhesion. Temporary sealing and inhibition of microbial adhesion are confirmed by product tests as well as preclinical in vivo and in vitro tests. Silver Graft prostheses are available in different lengths and diameters. Mode of action The functional properties of Silver Graft are based on the principle that a highly porous textile construction is temporarily sealed by a biologically degradable mass, which does not possess any independent pharmacological properties. This modified bovine gelatin impregnation reduces the initial porosity of the textile prosthesis at the time of implantation of approximately to 0 ml/min/cm2. From outside the impregnation of the prosthesis is enzymatically degraded and absorbed within 4-6 weeks after implantation, as shown in a publication by Ueberueck et al. in 2005. During this time endogenous tissue incorporates the prosthesis into the surrounding tissue and takes over the sealing function. On the inner side of the prosthesis a cell layer is formed, referred to as pseudo neointima.\\xa0Silver Graft Helix is wrapped with an external polypropylene thread around the outside of the prosthetic wall to protect the prosthesis against mechanical pressure from outside and increase the kink-stability. Intended use MRI Safety and Compatibility Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) can be safely done in patients with implanted Silver Graft vascular prostheses under the following conditions: Advantages ::\\nThe silver ions on the graft surface have an antimicrobial (bacteriostatic and bactericidal) effect. Therefore, Silver Graft has a significant reduction of microbial adhesion to the surface of the textile prosthesis confirmed by preclinical in vivo and in vitro tests. Hereof a slow release of the silver ions ensures long-time antimicrobial properties. Investigations in cell cultures as well as in animals show the biocompatibility of Silver Graft. Indication ::\\nSilver Graft is intended for use as vascular prosthesis for replacement or bypass of diseased vessels in patients suffering from aneurysmal or occlusive disease. The supported helix variant is particularly intended for use in locations that are exerted to increased mechanical stress. E.g. this is the case for bypasses that are located directly under the skin or for above the knee. Reconstructive procedures on the aorta and in the peripheral area requiring a prosthesis with at least 6 mm in diameter. Axillofemoral and –bifemoral reconstructions are also indicated., Silver Graft can be implanted prophylactically as a protection against vascular graft infection. It is designed for long-term protection avoiding adhesion of microbes to the surface of the textile prosthesis., Static magnetic field: 1.5 T and 3 T, Maximum spatial field gradient: 6.6 T/m, Whole body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR): 2 W/kg,', 'link': 'https://www.bbraun.com/en/products/b/silver-graft.html'}\n",

This complication affects pediatric as well as adult patients and impairs their quality of life, cognitive function, and shunt survival [2]. Shunt infections mostly require removal of the shunt, antibiotic treatment and reimplantation [2]. Shunt infections can have severe consequences for the patient: They are associated with a higher risk for further complications, such as seizures, psychomotor retardation, and shunt failure, which increase morbidity and mortality [6–9]. For the neurosurgeon, shunt infections drastically increase the workload and in the worst-case scenario require additional unplanned surgeries. Use of antibiotic-impregnated catheters can prevent two-thirds of shunt infections [11], thus helping to reduce patient burden and improve patient outcome. MIETHKE’s new antibiotic-impregnated catheter XABO uses a balanced ratio of clindamycin hydrochloride and rifampicin to effectively fight gram-positive bacteria [12]. XABO antibiotic impregnated catheters offer long-lasting antimicrobial effects, easy handling, convenient storage and perfectly fit all our innovative MIETHKE valves. Patients can benefit from XABO’s optimized release kinetics: the antibiotics are released continuously over at least 38 days after implantation [14], ensuring that XABO’s antimicrobial activity covers the time window when the patient is most susceptible to infection [1, 15-17]. The high potency of the antibiotic impregnation allows for the release of low antibiotic doses, which prevents allergic reactions and minimizes the risk of resistance development. XABO’s initial antibiotic loading is retained thanks to the gentle sterilization process. In addition, XABO comes wrapped in a specifically designed complete package combination that minimizes degradation products [13], ensuring the antibiotic-impregnated catheter is kept in prime condition for longer. Thanks to the gentle sterilization process and safe packaging it is storable for up to 36 months and withstands temperatures up to 30°C without losing its effectiveness [18].

The free intraoperative decision for optimal socket position is also up to the screwing of the screw cup possible, an important advantage especially in the ceramic-ceramic articulation.

Cutting-inThin thread flanks and many self-tapping edges reduce the force required for cutting the thread. Thread flanks with opposite cutting angle intersect smoother and softer in the bony implant bed. Choosing this thread parameter enables a easy and safe implantation of the Screw Cup SC®. Cutting-in depthOnce the Screw Cup SC® achieved a good implant-bone contact in the thread base, special flutes grab into the bone layer. This causes a significant increase of the insertion torque. The surgeon thereby gets a tactile feedback on the final and correct screwing depth. Modular cup inserts The conical anchoring principle of the Screw Cup® SC inner surface enables a safe anchoring of a ceramic Biolox® or polyethylene insert and thus prevents relative and micro-movements. The main load area is equipped with the maximum material thickness. The modular range of implants offers therefore the alternative: ceramic or polyethylene insert. The implant components can be individually adapted to the requirements of the patient.', 'link': 'https://www.bbraun.com/en/products/b1/screw-cup-sc-acetabularcupsystem.html'}\n",

In vivo performance. Vitelene® is a highly crosslinked polyethylene blended with vitamin E. Vitamin E provides long-term oxidation protection by binding free radicals through the release of H atoms. Polyethylene powder GUR 1020 is mixed with vitamin E (0.1 % - α-tocopherol) and pressed into sheets. Afterwards a total dose of 80 kGy electron beam radiation is applied to crosslink the blank product. Vitelene® inserts are manufactured using CNC technology and sterilized with ethylene oxide. Vitelene® needs no thermal treatment and has, therefore, balanced mechanical properties. It is characterized by wear and oxidation resistance. The articulation material Vitelene® is offered with the AESCULAP® acetabular cup systems Plasmafit®, Plasmafit® Dual Mobility as well as Plasmafit® Revision. Highly crosslinked polyethylene with vitamin E In contrast to polyethylene implants which are doped with vitamin E by diffusion as finished parts, blending of polyethylene by mixing vitamin E already into the raw powder guarantees a vitamin E concentration also in the deep areas of the material. Thanks to its excellent wear and oxidation resistance and balanced mechanical properties, Vitelene® represents the latest generation of highly crosslinked polyethylene for total hip arthroplasty. Good longterm results The wear rate of Vitelene® is very low even after extreme artificial aging. The vitamin E concentration is still sufficient to eliminate oxidative reactions and therefore reduces wear throughout the whole lifespan of the total hip arthroplasty. Oxidation leads to degradation of polyethylene. Vitamin E increases the resistance of polyethylene against oxidative processes and strengthens the bearing material. The mechanical properties impact strength, tensile strength and elongation of Vitelene® are unchanged even after 42 days of artificial aging. Thus the laboratory tests show an excellent longterm stability of Vitelene® against mechanical stress.', 'link': 'https://www.bbraun.com/en/products/b0/vitelene.html'}\n",

The cementless implants are coated with a layer of fine titanium powder applied in a plasmaspray process under vacuum. The Plasmapore® pore sizes range from 50 to 200 μm with a microporosity of 35 % and a thickness of 0.35 mm.These characteristics are optimal for bone ingrowth. Plasmapore® is a very rough surface and supports primary stability better than alternative coatings.All cementless Aesculap hip stem systems and acetabular cup systems are offered with this coating.Highly crystallized calcium phosphate (CaP) is used as the bioactive material for Plasmapore® μ-CaP. The Plasmapore® surface is combined with a very thin CaP layer of 20 μm, which is applied electrochemically. This Plasmapore® μ-CaP surface accelerates direct bone-implant contact and resorbs without giant cell reactions within 8-12 weeks.The modular Prevision® revision hip stem and the short hip stem Metha® are coated exclusively with Plasmapore® μ-CaP. Plasmapore® with Dicalcium PhosphateThe well-known characteristics of calcium phosphates such as HAC (hydroxylapatite) and TCP (tricalcium phosphate), and various HAC/TCP combinations led to Aesculap’s selection of dicalcium phosphate dehydrate (CaHPO4 x 2H2O) for use with Plasmapore®.Dicalcium phosphate dehydrate (DCPD) is very soluble in vivo, and dissolves into calcium and phosphate ions. During the acellular dissolving process, calcium and phosphate ions are continuously released in a ratio of 1:1, which are then available for bone modeling.In contrast, the poorly soluble hydroxyapatite (HAC) releases only calcium ions from non-HAC calcium compounds (CaO) resulting from the manufacturing process, but almost no phosphate ions.The resorbable tricalcium phosphate (TCP) stimulates giant cell reactions, and is therefore not optimal for use with orthopaedic implants. In orthopaedic implants the transition between primary and secondary implant stability is a continuous process of bone remodeling, characterized by apposition and resorption at the implant surface. The DCPD layer supports the continuous release of calcium and phosphate ions and encourages the formation of new bone structures at the bone-implant interface. Due to the continuous dissolving process of the calcium phosphate, the pores of the Plasmapore® coating remain open for bony ingrowth. Improved bone contactThe features of thin calcium phosphate surfaces are important in the short postoperative term. The dicalcium phosphate μ-CaP layer is resorbed within 8-12 weeks in vivo. The dissolving process takes place without any giant cell activity. Simulation tests of the solution behavior of HAC and μ-CaP show a different ion release of μ-CaP in comparison to hydroxylapatite ceramic surfaces. HAC surfaces do not release phosphate ions but in the initial solution phase, calcium ions are released from non-HAP calcium compounds (CaO) resulting from certain manufacturing processes. In contrast, μ-CaP dicalcium phosphate releases phosphate and calcium ions during the entire resorption period with a ratio of 1:1. These ions are available for bone synthesis. Due to the osteoconductive characteristics of calcium phosphate, the bone is brought into direct contact with the implant surface.', 'link': 'https://www.bbraun.com/en/products/b1/plasmapore.html'}\n",

      "{'sub1': 'Orthopaedic Surgery', 'sub2': 'Knee Arthroplasty', 'name': 'VEGA System®', 'description': 'The posterior stabilized VEGA Knee System was developed to fulfill the modern-day requirements of patient and surgeons for a modern knee implant system. The following objectives were considered in its design: Natural kinematics through a rollback and a pivotal motion around the medial condyleDuring flexion, the natural knee shows increased rollback of the femur on the lateral side while the femur rotates around the medial center.[1] The asymmetric cam design of VEGA facilitates this lateral rollback and medial rotation, and therefore enables a natural pivotal motion.[2] Stability even in high flexionBased on the design and the position of the PS box and post, the contact point of the box and post move distally with an increase of flexion. Therefore the increased jumping distance in flexion can reduce the subluxation risk. The synchronized contact surfaces between the articulating components maximize the bearing surface stress distribution in extension, reducing the risk of delamination. The high congruency between femur and tibia in extension as well as the line contact up to 160° of flexion stabilizes the patient’s movements and reduces wear. To reach higher varus-valgus stability a PS+ gliding surface with a mediolaterally wider PS post is available. Posterior inclination of the post design prevents anterior impingement with the extensor mechanism and increases resistance to dislocation. Soft tissue friendly and bone sparing implant design [2]Besides the reconstruction of natural kinematics, two attributes were in the foreground during the development of the VEGA Knee System. A soft tissue friendly design as well as the reduction of bone loss. 13 femur sizes, including standard and narrow sizes, and 11 tibial sizes, including standard and AP+ sizes, offer a wide range for a better bone fit regardless of gender, size, morphotype or race. Additionally, the VEGA System®’s narrow low-profile box helps to preserve bone and results in stable patellar tracking. A short tibial stem design as well as slim tibial wings support the bone sparing philosophy of VEGA. Furthermore the curved wing design facilitates a high rotational stability. Long-term performance through innovative materials\\xa0Advanced Surface: Wear is the number one reason for long-term knee replacement revisions.[3] To combat this issue, the AS coating can deliver up to a 65 % reduction in wear when compared to a CoCr prosthesis, as demonstrated in testing with other Aesculap knee designs. Furthermore, with the AS coating metal ion concentrations remain low and are below any biological threshold. This makes the AS coated implants an ideal solution for patients who are allergic to metal. The AS multilayer coating reduces the hardness from top to bottom in a gradient-like fashion, resulting in an improved elastic modulus. This makes it stable against mechanical stresses and strains.[4-7] Beta Polyethylene: All of Aesculap’s polyethylenes are sterilized under Beta radiation, which reduces oxidation, decelerates the aging process, and yields better wear rates.[8-10] Easy handling and precise results with the new generation of IQ instruments as well as the OrthoPilot® Navigation System Patient specific with OrthoPilot® Navigation, User-friendly with IQ Instruments,', 'link': 'https://www.bbraun.com/en/products/b1/vega-system.html'}\n",

Ensure that the wound edges are easily approximated. (Fig. 1), Screw the Applicator Tip onto the threaded tube in a clockwise direction until the applicator is tight and seated on the tube. The applicator will puncture the foil membrane on the tube once seated and adhesive will be allowed to flow. (Fig. 2), Hold the Micro tube tip downwards, and the 1mm version horizontal. Gently squeeze the tube from the bottom until the adhesive becomes visible through the applicator device. Keep the device pointed away from the patient, until ready to apply the adhesive. (Fig. 3), While approximating skin edges, apply by squeezing the tube gently and continuously as you spread the adhesive back and forth over the wound site. Continue to hold the wound edges in approximation until the adhesive becomes tacky - typically less than 20 seconds. A smooth and even coat of adhesive is desirable. (Fig. 4), Once adhesive has completely polymerised (non-tacky) you may cover the site with a secondary bandage. If a secondary bandage is used, DO NOT apply to the adhesive area until it is completely tack free. Applying whilst tacky may result in adhesive removal when removing the secondary bandage and possibly dehiscence of the wound site.
